          Starts from baseline under the offensive basket up to the the 1st
          hash/lane mark and extends 1-2 steps outside the lane box. This zone
          is the most difficult to master because of its closeness to the
          basket. It also has the largest variety of shots/finishes.

        <div className="Explanation">
          <p>
            We'll start here because this is where a lot players struggle.
            Reason being, the player has to decide what shot to shoot, how to
            shoot it and when to shoot. And all of this in a matter of seconds.
            But there’s good news; we can break these shots into 2 categories, 1
            foot and 2 foot finishes. Typically, 1 foot finishes happen with
            minimal defensive contact to the way to the basket & the defense is
            behind the offense. 2 foot finishes happen when there’s defensive
            contact on the way to and at the basket & the defense is beside the
            offense. There are also 6 or 7 shots that can be shot off 1 or 2
            feet. Once a player becomes efficient in his/her decision making in
            this Zone, a few things will happen:
            <ol id="#1">
              <li>
                They'll become better decision makers in their overall game.
              </li>
              <li>They’ll play with more confidence.</li>
              <li>They'll become better all around players.</li>
              <li> Their basketball IQ should increase.</li>
            </ol>

                      <b>How:</b> player would shoot a right handed shot,
                      usually off the glass, while jumping off the left foot and
                      driving the right knee upward to for jump height. Player
                      may shoot over hand, like a jump shot, or an underhand
                      scoop shot, similar to the picture above.{" "}

                      half court situation. Also, shot when a player drives to
                      the basket and has little to no contact with any defense
